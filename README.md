# voteo
Voteo is a Flask application that searches voter records to build a database conatining voter information. 
Currently, voteo only works with Austin, Texas; and Seattle, Washington voter records databases. 
 
```Future plans``` 
* Include more counties/parishes and states to compare the amount of information different places provide
about voters.
 
```Reasoning```
* Each county, or parish, and state in the country chooses what information to reveal about voters. It should be minimal. And 

* A federal information security standard should be created, or these systems should be covered under FIPS. 

* Voter records databases should only reveal minimal information. 

* All states/counties/parishes should reveal the same amount of information. 

* Among information revealed by Texas, and Washington are address, date of birth, and name. Whereas Louisiana 
provides party information, and does not reveal addresses.
